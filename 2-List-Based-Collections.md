# 1. Welcome to Collections
...

# 2. List

- list has properties of a collection
- objects in list have an order
- exact implementation for adding elements will change based on language and the type of data structure
- several types of lists
- different programming language treat them differently
- list sometimes incorporated as core feature of a programming language
- what that looks can vary wildly.

# 3. Arrays

- most common implementation of list
- in many languages, ability to create an array is built in as a core feature
- in some lang, array can have different types (can't use that as a rule to define arrays)
- nice to say array has a set size that you determine right when you create them (only true in some prog language)
- One big feature that differentiates arrays from list
  - each array has a location called an index
  - index is just the number associated with that place in the array
- if need to access middle element, using an array can be great choice.
- insertion and deletion can be messy with arrays though
  - opereation pretty inefficient, since you need to move every affected element.
  - worst case the operation takes linear time or O(n)
